### Week 11-12: Integration and Functional Testing

- **Integration Testing**
  - **Testing Interactions Between Web Scraping and API Code**
    - Ensure that components work together as expected.
    - Example of an integration test scenario:
      ```python
      def test_integration():
          scraped_data = scrape_data()
          api_response = send_to_api(scraped_data)
          assert api_response.status_code == 200
      ```

- **Functional Testing**
  - **Creating Test Cases Based on User Scenarios**
    - Focus on testing the application from the userâ€™s perspective.
    - Example of a functional test case:
      ```plaintext
      Test Case: User logs in successfully
      Steps:
        1. Navigate to login page.
        2. Enter valid credentials.
        3. Click on the login button.
      Expected Result: User is redirected to the dashboard.
      ```

- **Error Handling and Logging**
  - **Implementing Logging in Your Code**
    - Use the `logging` module to log errors and important events.
    - Example of basic logging:
      ```python
      import logging

      logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
      logging.info('Application started.')
      ```
