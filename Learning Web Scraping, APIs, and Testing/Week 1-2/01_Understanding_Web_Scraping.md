### Understanding Web Scraping
- **What is Web Scraping?**
  - Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites.
  - It typically involves fetching the webpage content and parsing it to retrieve specific information.

- **Legal and Ethical Considerations**
  - Always check the website's `robots.txt` file to see if scraping is allowed.
  - Respect the website's terms of service and copyright policies.
  - Avoid overloading the server with too many requests in a short period (rate limiting).
